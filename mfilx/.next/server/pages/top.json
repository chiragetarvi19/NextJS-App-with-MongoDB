Adolescent siblings Alexander and Fanny Ekdahl lead a relatively joyous and exuberant life with their well-off extended paternal family, led by the family matriarch, their grandmother, Helena Ekdahl. The openness of the family culture is exemplified by Helena's now deceased husband ending up becoming best friends with one of her lovers, a Jewish puppet maker named Isak Jacobi, and their Uncle Gustav Adolf's open liaison with one of the family maids, Maj, who everyone in the family adores, even Gustav Adolf's wife, Alma. Between the siblings, Alexander in particular has inherited the family's love of storytelling, his parents and his grandmother who are actors and who manage their own theater. Things change for Alexander and Fanny when their father, Oscar, dies shortly after Christmas 1907. Although she truly does believe she loves him, the children's mother, Emilie, decides to marry Bishop Edvard Verg√®rus, who she first met as the officiate at Oscar's funeral. She also wants a father figure for the children. Going into the marriage, Emilie has inclinations that it will be a much different life than she had with the Ekdahls, but is not prepared for the harsh, austere and strict life Edvard rules with an iron fist. Emilie, Alexander and Fanny end up being prisoners in the bishop's stark and humorless house. As Alexander butts head with his stepfather and tries to learn how to keep to his own principles while obeying Edvard, Emilie tries to figure out a way to regain her and her children's own destiny, as Edvard will not consent to divorce, and her \"desertion\" in the eyes of the law means that Alexander and Fanny would become his wards.","imdb":{"rating":8.1,"votes":38461,"id":83922},"year":1982,"plot":"Two young Swedish children experience the many comedies and tragedies of their family, the Ekdahls.","genres":["Drama"],"rated":"R","metacritic":100,"title":"Fanny and Alexander","lastupdated":"2015-09-01 00:24:03.630000000","languages":["Swedish","German","Yiddish","English"],"writers":["Ingmar Bergman"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":4.3,"numReviews":20884,"meter":94},"dvd":"2004-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","critic":{"rating":8.9,"numReviews":33,"meter":100},"lastUpdated":"2015-08-17T18:56:50.000Z","rotten":0,"production":"Embassy Pictures Corporation","fresh":33},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmQzMDE5ZWQtOTU3ZS00ZjdhLWI0OTctZDNkODk4YThmOTRhL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":1,"released":"1982-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","awards":{"wins":25,"nominations":8,"text":"Won 4 Oscars.

The castle's resident, an angry beast, sentences him to one of two options for the theft of the rose: his own death, or that of one of his daughters. As she feels she is the cause of her father's predicament (despite her sisters asking for far more lavish gifts), Belle sacrifices herself to the beast. Upon arriving at the castle, Belle finds that the beast, whose grotesqueness she cannot deny, does not want to kill her, but wants to marry her and lavish her with riches. He does not force her, but he will ask her every night to marry him, these times the only ones when he will appear to her. She vows never to say yes. As Belle resigns herself to her mortal fate and looks deeper into the beast - whose grotesque exterior masks a kind but tortured soul - will her thoughts change?

They all admit that the marriage was by no means close to being harmonious - Arnold and Elaine eventually got divorced - but the sons talk of their father, while also not being always there for them, as being a good man. This fa√®ade of respectability masks the fact that Arnold was buying and distributing child pornography. Following a sting operation to confirm this fact, the authorities began to investigate Arnold for sexual abuse of the minor-aged male students of his computer classes, which he held in the basement of the family home. Based on interviews with the students, not only was Arnold charged with and ultimately convicted of multiple counts of sodomy and sexual abuse of these boys but so was eighteen year old Jesse, who was mentioned by many as the aggressor of the two in the acts. Arnold admitted that he is a pedophile, but that he did not abuse the boys in his class as charged and convicted. The trial process brought out the dysfunction that previously existed within the family. But the issue of Arnold and Jesse's guilt of these acts is hotly debated among the family, among the authorities, among the media and among the students of the computer classes.","languages":["English"],"released":"2003-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","directors":["Andrew Jarecki"],"rated":"NOT RATED","awards":{"wins":26,"nominations":8,"text":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

Dumont, on the suggestion of her immediate supervisor, the shop foreman Jean-Marc, figures that her section of the company can function with sixteen people working full time with a bit of overtime instead of seventeen with no overtime, that seventeenth person being Sandra. Because of the global competition the company faces, Dumont decides the company can only finance the annual bonuses for those sixteen employees, which are EUR1,000 per person, or Sandra's job, leaving the decision to those sixteen. On a Friday near the end of her medical leave, Sandra learns of this situation from her friend and co-worker Juliette after the \"show of hands\" vote is held, the result a 13-3 decision for the bonuses over Sandra's job. Because Juliette knows Jean-Marc, who is determined to get rid of Sandra, influenced the vote by scare mongering through misinformation, Juliette and Sandra, at the end of the working day on Friday, are able to convince Dumont to hold another secret ballot on Monday morning, with Sandra needing a majority to keep her job, meaning nine votes.

She and Grant made this decision together, although a still lucid Fiona seems to have made peace with the decision and her diagnosis more so than Grant. With respect to the facility, what Grant has the most difficulty with are what he sees as the sadness associated with the facility's second floor - where the more advanced cases are housed - but most specifically the facility's policy of no visitors within the first thirty days of admission to allow the patient to adjust more easily to their new life there. Based on what he sees when he is finally able to visit Fiona, Grant ultimately makes a request of Marian Barque, the wife of one of the other patients, a semi-comatose Aubrey Barque, with whom Fiona has struck a friendship and who is now at home permanently with Marian.

During their relationship, Jules has floundered in her \"nine to five\" life, sometimes trying to start a business - always unsuccessfully - or being the stay-at-home mom. She is currently trying to start a landscape design business. They have two teen-aged children, Joni (conceived by Nic) and Laser (by Jules). Although not exact replicas, each offspring does more closely resemble his/her biological mother in temperament. Joni and Laser are also half-siblings, having the same unknown sperm donor father. Shortly after Joni's eighteenth birthday and shortly before she plans to leave the house and head off to college, Laser, only fifteen and underage to do so, pleads with her to try and contact their sperm donor father. Somewhat reluctantly, she does. He is late thirty-something Paul, a co-op farmer and restaurateur. Despite his seemingly successful businesses, Paul has always shirked responsibility, most specifically in his personal life. After Joni and Laser meet with Paul, Nic and Jules learn what their children have done and, although they don't want Paul infiltrating their lives, want to meet him - especially as Joni and Laser seem to want to maintain some sort of relationship with him. As Paul's relationship with the entire family grows (which includes his hiring Jules to design and construct his backyard), they have an effect on what he wants in life.

From acclaimed director Steve James and bestselling author Alex Kotlowitz, this film is an unusually intimate journey into the stubborn, persistence of violence in our cities. Shot over the course of a year out of Kartemquin Films, The Interrupters captures a period in Chicago when it became a national symbol for the violence in our cities. During that period, the city was besieged by high-profile incidents, most notably the brutal beating of Derrion Albert, a Chicago High School student, whose death was caught on videotape. The film's main subjects work for an innovative organization, CeaseFire, which believes that the spread of violence mimics the spread of infectious diseases, and so the treatment should be similar: go after the most infected, and stop the infection at its source. The singular mission of the \"Violence Interrupters\" - who have credibility on the streets because of their own personal histories -- is to intervene in conflicts before they explode into violence. In The Interrupters, Ameena Matthews, whose father is Jeff Fort, one of the city's most notorious gang leaders, was herself a drug ring enforcer. But having children and finding solace in her Muslim faith pulled her off the streets and grounded her. In the wake of Derrion Albert's death, Ameena becomes a close confidante to his mother, and helps her through her grieving. Ameena, who is known among her colleagues for her fearlessness, befriends a feisty teenaged girl who reminds her of herself at that age. The film follows that friendship over the course of many months, as Ameena tries to nudge the troubled girl in the right direction. Cobe Williams, scarred by his father's murder, was in and out of prison, until he had had enough. His family - particularly a young son - helped him find his footing. Cobe disarms others with his humor and his general good nature. His most challenging moment comes when he has to confront a man so bent on revenge that Cobe has to pat him down to make sure he's put away his gun. Like Ameena, he gets deeply involved in the lives of those he encounters, including a teenaged boy just out of prison and a young man from his old neighborhood who's squatting in a foreclosed home. Eddie Bocanegra is haunted by a murder he committed when he was seventeen. His CeaseFire work is a part of his repentance for what he did. Eddie is most deeply disturbed by the aftereffects of the violence on children, and so he spends much of his time working with younger kids in an effort to both keep them off the streets and to get support to those who need it - including a 16-year-old girl whose brother died in her arms. Soulful and empathic, Eddie, who learned to paint in prison, teaches art to children, trying to warn them of the debilitating trauma experienced by those touched by the violence. The Interrupters follows Ameena, Cobe and Eddie as they go about their work, and while doing so reveals their own inspired journeys of hope and redemption. The film attempts to make sense of what CeaseFire's Tio Hardiman calls, simply, \"the madness\".","imdb":{"rating":7.5,"votes":2974,"id":1319744},"year":2011,"plot":"A year in the life of a city grappling with urban violence.","genres":["Documentary","Crime"],"rated":"UNRATED","metacritic":86,"title":"The Interrupters","lastupdated":"2015-09-16 13:00:59.003000000","languages":["English"],"writers":["Alex Kotlowitz (New York Times magazine article)"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://interrupters.kartemquin.com/","viewer":{"rating":4,"numReviews":5318,"meter":82},"dvd":"2012-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","critic":{"rating":8.3,"numReviews":85,"meter":99},"boxOffice":"$0.3M","consensus":"Impeccably crafted and edited, The Interrupters is a tough and honest documentary about street violence that truly has the power to inspire change.","rotten":1,"production":"Cinema Guild","lastUpdated":"2015-08-18T18:16:50.000Z","fresh":84},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3MjM0ODcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTg1MjIwNg@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":0,"released":"2011-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","awards":{"wins":10,"nominations":14,"text":"10 wins & 14 nominations."},"countries":["USA"],"cast":["Tio Hardiman","Ameena Matthews","Toya Batey","Cobe Williams"],"directors":["Steve James"],"runtime":125},{"_id":"573a13e6f29313caabdc6a33","fullplot":"Joaquim Pinto has been living with HIV and VHC for almost twenty years.

Today she is a beacon of hope and a pillar of strength for hundreds of women and girls as young as fourteen who want to change their own lives. 'Dreamcatcher' explores the cycle of neglect, violence and exploitation which each year leaves thousands upon thousands of girls and women feeling that prostitution is their only option to survive. By following the very charming, charismatic and truly empathic Brenda, we enter the lives of young women and see in verite footage their realities from their points of view. While the world may overlook these women and men, thankfully Brenda has not, providing an unflinching expose which contrasts seeming hopelessness against the difference that one person can make in the lives of many.","languages":["English"],"released":"2015-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","directors":["Kim Longinotto"],"rated":"TV-MA","awards":{"wins":1,"nominations":4,"text":"1 win & 4 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-09-11 00:33:39.187000000","year":2015,"imdb":{"rating":6.5,"votes":113,"id":3215846},"type":"movie"},{"_id":"573a13e3f29313caabdc0b5a","plot":"Khosrow and Morteza set out on a mission to kill someone.

Inexperienced Eddie turns to the only other married one among the bunch, electronics salesman and music aficionado Shrevie, for advice, he who may not be the best person from who to ask advice on marriage since he doesn't yet realize that he probably got married to his wife Beth for the wrong reasons. Indeed, Beth, who has lost her sense of identity, is unhappy in their marriage, and contemplates having an affair with someone who provides what she believes is a sympathetic shoulder. Hairdresser and law school student Boogie is the player of the bunch, he who has some major financial problems because of his quest for the fast buck.

The arrangement with his client, known only to him as \"the director\", is to provide the audio recording of the discussion and photographs of the couple directly to him alone in return for payment. Based on circumstances with the director's assistant, Martin Stett, and what Harry ultimately hears on the recording, Harry believes that the lives of the young couple are in jeopardy. Harry used to be detached from what he recorded, but is now concerned ever since the deaths of three people that were the direct result of a previous audio recording he made for another job. Harry not only has to decide if he will turn the recording over to the director, but also if he will try and save the couple's lives using information from the recording. As Harry goes on a quest to find out what exactly is happening on this case, he finds himself in the middle of his worst nightmare.","imdb":{"rating":7.9,"votes":69112,"id":71360},"year":1974,"plot":"A paranoid, secretive surveillance expert has a crisis of conscience when he suspects that a couple he is spying on will be murdered.","genres":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"rated":"PG","metacritic":86,"title":"The Conversation","lastupdated":"2015-09-12 00:33:15.760000000","languages":["English"],"writers":["Francis Ford Coppola"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":4.1,"numReviews":33748,"meter":90},"dvd":"2000-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","critic":{"rating":8.7,"numReviews":46,"meter":98},"lastUpdated":"2015-09-15T17:05:57.000Z","consensus":"This tense, paranoid thriller presents Francis Ford Coppola at his finest -- and makes some remarkably advanced arguments about technology's role in society that still resonate today.","rotten":1,"production":"Paramount Pictures","fresh":45},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTQxYWJlYTgtMTk5MS00ZGFiLWI5MWItYjhkNjM3YmUyNjYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUwNzk3NDc@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":0,"released":"1974-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","awards":{"wins":18,"nominations":11,"text":"Nominated for 3 Oscars.

Act 1 begins in November 1957, when sixteen year old Genevi√®ve, who works in her widowed mother's umbrella shop called \"Les parapluies de Cherbourg\", and twenty year old Guy, who works as a mechanic at a gas station, are madly in love and want to get married. They are reluctant to tell anyone not only of their want to get married, but of their relationship. Genevi√®ve believes her mother will think her too young, and would want her to marry someone with better prospects, especially considering her own tenuous financial situation. And Guy is more concerned now about not abandoning his ailing godmother, Aunt √®lise, who raised him, and who he looks after along with a young woman named Madeleine. Act 2, told largely from Genevi√®ve's perspective, begins in February 1958. Guy, drafted to fight for the French in Algeria, has been gone for two months, and is expected to be gone for two years. Genevi√®ve rarely hears from Guy. In order to solve their many problems, Genevi√®ve's mother wants her to marry Roland Cassard, a refined and well appointed diamond merchant who travels often for his work but who is devoted to Genevi√®ve whenever he is in Cherbourg. Genevi√®ve, who still loves Guy but who she is slowly losing in terms of him as a person in her mind, has to decide what to do about Roland, especially as it may become more difficult to accept his proposal as time progresses. Act 3, told largely from Guy's perspective, begins in March 1959 upon his military discharge and return to Cherbourg. Life circumstances, including what happened during the war, has changed Guy, and he has to figure out what the next phase of his life will look like because of his new perspective. Act 4 takes place on one snowy day in December 1963, when Genevi√®ve and Guy are shown in their current lives, that based on what has happened in those previous three acts.","languages":["French"],"released":"1964-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","directors":["Jacques Demy"],"writers":["Jacques Demy (scenario and dialogue)"],"awards":{"wins":10,"nominations":2,"text":"Nominated for 5 Oscars.

To the chagrin of his superiors, Dan bucks the outlined curriculum of historical facts in favor of the philosophy of historical events, generally discussing the concept of dialectics. As such, he captures the imagination of his students, at least in the classroom. Outside of the classroom, Dan's life is in shambles. He has a distant but cordial relationship with his family. He uses illicit drugs rampantly. Although his former girlfriend Rachel was able to clean up her drug habit, Dan believes that rehab will not work for him. Due to a combination of these issues, he treats women poorly. Thirteen year old Drey is a student in his class and a player on his basketball team. Drey has her own problems. Her parents are divorced, with her father a virtually non-existent figure in her life and her EMT mother generally absent as she is always working to provide for Drey. Her older brother Mike is incarcerated for selling drugs for a local dealer named Frank. Mike took the fall for Frank, who in turn protects Drey whether she wants to be associated with him or not. Dan and Drey's relationship changes when Drey catches Dan, believing he is alone, smoking crack in the girl's locker room bathroom. He is totally stoned. Their resulting friendship, which is seen as inappropriate by the few who know, is based on each being unable to deal with their own life, but feeling like they can be at least a minor salvation in the other's life.","languages":["English"],"released":"2006-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","directors":["Ryan Fleck"],"writers":["Ryan Fleck","Anna Boden"],"awards":{"wins":36,"nominations":33,"text":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

A servant reads to him a list of activities for the day, including a meeting with his ministers, marine biology research, and writing his son. Hirohito muses about the impact on such schedules when the Americans arrive but is told that as long as there is a solitary Japanese person living, the Americans will not reach The Emperor. Hirohito replies that he at times feels like he himself will be the last Japanese person left alive. The servant reminds him that he is a deity, not a person, but Hirohito points out that he has a body just like any other man. He later reflects on the causes of the war when dictating observations about a hermit crab, and then about the peace to come when composing a letter to his son. Soon enough General Douglas MacArthur's personal car is sent to bring him through the ruins of Tokyo for a meeting with the supreme commander of the victorious occupying forces. Underlying all the conversation that follows is the question of Hirohito's future, either as Emperor or a war criminal. The two very different men strangely bond after sharing dinner and Havana cigars, and Hirohito leaves, renounces his divine nature, and is re-united with his family in the palace to face a new life to help re-build his war-ravaged country as a constitutional monarch.","languages":["Japanese","English"],"released":"2005-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","directors":["Aleksandr Sokurov"],"writers":["Yuriy Arabov","Jeremy Noble"],"awards":{"wins":3,"nominations":5,"text":"3 wins & 5 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-07-31 00:01:29.223000000","year":2005,"imdb":{"rating":7.4,"votes":2041,"id":439817},"countries":["Russia","Italy","Switzerland","France"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":3.7,"numReviews":984,"meter":78},"dvd":"2010-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","critic":{"rating":8,"numReviews":36,"meter":92},"boxOffice":"$46.4k","consensus":"Certainly not for the impatient, Aleksandr Sokurov's deliberately paced look at Hirohito in the waning days of World War II is both enlightening and admirable in its restraint.","rotten":3,"production":"Lorber Films","lastUpdated":"2015-08-17T18:35:25.000Z","fresh":33}},{"_id":"573a13bff29313caabd5f21b","plot":"In 1937, Japan occupied Nanjing, the Chinese capital.

That excitement is dampened slightly upon Terry's arrival, when she learns that he, broke, is only there to borrow money. As adults, Sammy, who works as a lending officer in the local bank, is seen as the responsible sibling, while unfocused Terry is seen as the irresponsible drifter. Regardless, Sammy welcomes what ends up being Terry's longer than planned visit if only so that he can help take care of Rudy, who has no adult male figure in his life. Rudy has never known his deadbeat biological father, with whom Sammy wants nothing to do. As Terry - acting as the supposed adult male role model figure - gets to know Rudy, and as Sammy deals with the issues in her life which includes figuring out what her relationship to longtime friend/lover Bob Steegerson means, and how to deal with her straight-laced micro-managing new boss Brian Everett, the maturity level between Sammy and Terry is not as far apart as it appears on the surface.","imdb":{"rating":7.7,"votes":21119,"id":203230},"year":2000,"plot":"A single mother's life is thrown into turmoil after her struggling, rarely-seen younger brother returns to town.","genres":["Drama"],"rated":"R","metacritic":85,"title":"You Can Count on Me","lastupdated":"2015-09-05 00:55:48.837000000","languages":["English"],"writers":["Kenneth Lonergan"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.youcancountonmemovie.com","viewer":{"rating":3.9,"numReviews":9896,"meter":89},"dvd":"2001-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","critic":{"rating":8.1,"numReviews":101,"meter":95},"boxOffice":"$8.4M","consensus":"You Can Count On Me may look like it belongs on the small screen, but the movie surprises with its simple yet affecting story.

With the coming to power of the Nazis, all this changed. Between 1933 and 1945 100,000 men were arrested for homosexuality under Paragraph 175, the sodomy provision of the German penal code dating back to 1871. Some were imprisoned, others were sent to concentration camps. Of the latter, only about 4,000 survived. Today, fewer than ten of these men are known to be living. Five of them have now come forward to tell their stories for the first time in this powerful new film. The Nazi persecution of homosexuals may be the last untold story of the Third Reich. Paragraph 175 fills a crucial gap in the historical record, and reveals the lasting consequences of this hidden chapter of 20th century history, as told through personal stories of men and women who lived through it: the half Jewish gay resistance fighter who spent the war helping refugees in Berlin; the Jewish lesbian who escaped to England with the help of a woman she had a crush on; the German Christian photographer who was arrested and imprisoned for homosexuality, then joined the army on his release because he \"wanted to be with men\"; the French Alsatian teenager who watched as his lover was tortured and murdered in the camps. These are stories of survivors -- sometimes bitter, but just as often filled with irony and humor; tortured by their memories, yet infused with a powerful will to endure. Their moving testimonies, rendered with evocative images of their lives and times, tell a haunting, compelling story of human resilience in the face of unspeakable cruelty. Intimate in its portrayals, sweeping in its implications, Paragraph 175 raises provocative questions about memory, history, and identity.","languages":["French","English","German"],"released":"2002-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","directors":["Rob Epstein","Jeffrey Friedman"],"writers":["Sharon Wood"],"awards":{"wins":9,"nominations":5,"text":"9 wins & 5 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-09-11 00:34:44.583000000","year":2000,"imdb":{"rating":7.9,"votes":1525,"id":236576},"countries":["UK","Germany","USA"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":3.9,"numReviews":965,"meter":83},"dvd":"2002-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","critic":{"rating":7.4,"numReviews":15,"meter":93},"lastUpdated":"2015-09-01T19:08:25.000Z","rotten":1,"production":"Telling Pictures","fresh":14}},{"_id":"573a13a2f29313caabd0c170","plot":"This documentary tells four stories of Apartheid in South Africa, as seen through the eyes of the Truth and Reconciliation commission.

Electrician and sometimes rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof lives hard, which includes heavy smoking, drinking, drug use (primarily cocaine) and casual sex. He is racist and homophobic. While in the hospital on a work related injury, the doctors discover and inform him that he is HIV+, and that he will most-likely die within thirty days. Ron is initially in angry denial that he would have a disease that only \"faggots\" have, but upon quick reflection comes to the realization that the diagnosis is probably true. He begins to read whatever research is available about the disease, which at this time seems to be most effectively treated by the drug AZT. AZT, however, is only in the clinical trials stage within the US. Incredulous that he, as a dying man, cannot pay for any drug which may save or at least prolong his life, he goes searching for it by whatever means possible. It eventually leads him to Mexico and a \"Dr.\" Vass, an American physician whose license was revoked in the US because of his AIDS related work against US regulations. Dr. Vass leads Ron to a cocktail of other drugs, some vitamins, he believes are more effective in treating the symptoms, since the virus, as Ron learns, will always be in the system of those who have been exposed to it. Ron begins to smuggle these drugs not approved by the FDA into the US, not only for his own use but for sale to other HIV+ persons. In this venture, he goes into an unlikely partnership with a HIV+ transgender woman named Rayon, who he met in the hospital and who has greater contact with AIDS patients through the gay community. As they try to work both above ground to get the meds to those that need them and underground to avoid detection by especially the FDA, Ron comes up with an idea to circumvent the fact of selling the drugs - which are not considered drugs yet since they are not FDA approved - directly to the HIV+ population, which then should should not be against the law. Richard Barkley and Dr. Sevard, the FDA's lead man on the file and one of Ron's doctors respectively, the latter who sees clinical trials as the only way to determine the efficacy of drugs despite the fact that Ron and others would have probably died already without these drugs, try to stop Ron and Rayon at every turn. Caught in the middle is Dr. Eve Saks, another of Ron's doctors, who understands why policies are place, but who can sympathize with Ron, Rayon and others - all her patients, directly or indirectly - in their situation.","languages":["English","Japanese"],"released":"2013-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","directors":["Jean-Marc Vall√®e"],"writers":["Craig Borten","Melisa Wallack"],"awards":{"wins":93,"nominations":60,"text":"Won 3 Oscars.

Since that time, he has become one of the leading advocates against cetaceans in captivity and for the preservation of cetaceans in the wild. O'Barry and filmmaker 'Louie Psihoyos (I)' go about trying to expose one of what they see as the most cruel acts against wild dolphins in the world in Taiji, Japan, where dolphins are routinely corralled, either to be sold alive to aquariums and marine parks, or slaughtered for meat. The primary secluded cove where this activity is taking place is heavily guarded. O'Barry and Psihoyos are well known as enemies by the authorities in Taiji, the authorities who will use whatever tactic to expel the two from Japan forever. O'Barry, Psihoyos and their team covertly try to film as a document of conclusive evidence this cruel behavior. They employ among others Hollywood cameramen and deep sea free divers. They also highlight what is considered the dangerous consumption of dolphin meat (due to its high concentration of mercury) which is often sold not as dolphin meat, and the Japanese government's methodical buying off of poorer third world nations for their support of Japan's whaling industry, that support most specifically at the International Whaling Commission.","imdb":{"rating":8.5,"votes":38009,"id":1313104},"year":2009,"plot":"Using state-of-the-art equipment, a group of activists, led by renowned dolphin trainer Ric O'Barry, infiltrate a cove near Taijii, Japan to expose both a shocking instance of animal abuse and a serious threat to human health.","genres":["Documentary","Crime"],"rated":"PG-13","metacritic":84,"title":"The Cove","lastupdated":"2015-09-04 00:21:08.053000000","languages":["English","Japanese"],"writers":["Mark Monroe"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.thecoviemovie.com/","viewer":{"rating":4.3,"numReviews":25324,"meter":94},"dvd":"2009-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","critic":{"rating":8,"numReviews":125,"meter":94},"boxOffice":"$0.6M","consensus":"Though decidedly one-sided, The Cove is an impeccably crafted, suspenseful expose of the covert slaughter of dolphins in Japan.","rotten":7,"production":"Roadside Attractions","lastUpdated":"2015-08-16T19:15:57.000Z","fresh":118},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM3NTRhMTctNTE2MS00YjJmLWE2ZmMtMmY3MWI0ODExMTMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA4NzY1MzY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":0,"released":"2009-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","awards":{"wins":39,"nominations":14,"text":"Won 1 Oscar.

Despite the vast wealth that comes with the land, Matt has decided to live solely on what he earns as a Honolulu lawyer. However, Matt has not had a perfect life living in Hawaiian paradise as many believe. He and his wife Elizabeth were having problems in their marriage. She recently got into a boating accident which has placed her in a coma. Their seventeen year old daughter Alex is in boarding school on the big island since they couldn't handle her rebellion, which was made all the worse by an argument of an unknown nature between mother and daughter during Alex's last visit home. And their ten year old daughter Scottie is starting to act out, which Matt doesn't know if he can handle, potentially raising her on his own. Matt decides to bring Alex home upon news that Elizabeth is brain dead, and that she will be pulled off life support. But revelations about Elizabeth and Alex's argument, which is tied indirectly to the issue of the land sale, leads to some decisions on Matt's part about what is best for him in both mourning Elizabeth's death and what is the best thing to do about the land, the two decisions which may be incompatible.","imdb":{"rating":7.4,"votes":194588,"id":1033575},"year":2011,"plot":"A land baron tries to reconnect with his two daughters after his wife is seriously injured in a boating accident.","genres":["Comedy","Drama"],"rated":"R","metacritic":84,"title":"The Descendants","lastupdated":"2015-08-31 00:00:16.077000000","languages":["English"],"writers":["Alexander Payne (screenplay)","Nat Faxon (screenplay)","Jim Rash (screenplay)","Kaui Hart Hemmings (novel)"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.foxsearchlight.com/thedescendants/","viewer":{"rating":3.8,"numReviews":68690,"meter":79},"dvd":"2012-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","critic":{"rating":8.1,"numReviews":236,"meter":89},"boxOffice":"$82.6M","consensus":"Funny, moving, and beautifully acted, The Descendants captures the unpredictable messiness of life with eloquence and uncommon grace.","rotten":26,"production":"Fox Searchlight Pictures","lastUpdated":"2015-09-13T10:02:38.000Z","fresh":210},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNTA1MTcyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjEyODczNQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":1,"released":"2011-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","awards":{"wins":78,"nominations":117,"text":"Won 1 Oscar.

In the later stages of his career, he takes his job lightly now, filing stories only on occasion, and no longer doing field work. But most important, this posting allows him to escape from what he considers a dreary life in London--including an unsatisfying marriage to a Catholic woman, who will never grant him a divorce--which in turn allows him to have an affair with a young Vietnamese ex-taxi dancer named Phuong, whom he loves and would marry if he were able. Phuong's sister doesn't much like Fowler if only because Fowler cannot provide a stable future for her. His idyllic life is threatened when head office suggests he go back to London. In this way, he decides to write a major story to prove to his superiors that he should stay in Saigon. In 1952, Fowler is called into the local police inspector's office to provide any information on his friend, thirty-ish American Alden Pyle, who has been found murdered. Fowler had met Pyle the previous year when he arrived in Vietnam to work as part of the American contingent in the Economic Aid Mission. Fowler and Pyle's relationship was not always harmonious, initially as Pyle admitted he too was in love with Phuong and wanted to marry her. That antagonistic relationship would extend to their professional lives, around Fowler believing that the story that would allow him to stay in Vietnam was the rise of a man named General Th√®, and Pyle's belief that a third power should come in to take over Vietnam from both the French and the communists. The question becomes whether Fowler knows more about Pyle's demise than he lets on to the inspector.","languages":["English","French","Vietnamese"],"released":"2003-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","directors":["Phillip Noyce"],"writers":["Graham Greene (novel)","Christopher Hampton (screenplay)","Robert Schenkkan (screenplay)"],"awards":{"wins":16,"nominations":7,"text":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

Some species, like the arctic tern, even fly from pole to pole. These long and often torturous treks are a matter of survival, to live in a hospitable climate and find sources of food. With the exception of migratory penguins, travel over oceans is especially difficult as the birds have little refuge unless there is something floating on the water, such as a ship, on which to land. Otherwise they must continue flying until they reach land. Some will not survive the migration due to predators, including man, illness or injury.

As such, it is like Grand Central Station for the duration of Kym's stay, which may not be the most conducive situation for her in constantly being exposed to the watching eyes of those who know and don't yet know her, but know of her situation. The reunion with her family members starts off well enough, but issues around Kym's release from rehab quickly surface. Kym and Rachel's father, Paul Buchman, wants to make sure that Kym is all right at all times, which to Kym feels instead like he doesn't trust her. Rachel slowly begins to resent Kym's situation taking over what is supposed to be the happiest day of her life, some of which is directed by Kym, some of which isn't. One person present but largely not included in the last minute wedding planning work is Kym and Rachel's mother, Abby, from who Paul is divorced. The two have since married other people. Outwardly, Abby has been nurturing of Kym throughout her life. However, what is one of the key moments in Kym's drug induced life, and in their collective family's lives, may profoundly affect the wedding.

But Zac has the most contempt for his second eldest brother, the shiftless druggie Raymond. To his devout Catholic mother, Zac is her miracle son, both for being born the same day as Jesus Christ (a fact which Zac has always hated), and because a Tupperware-selling mystic once told her that he has the power to heal. Laurianne has always coddled Zac, the two who have a special if unspoken bond. But Zac wants more to please his father, who wants more than anything in his sons that they grow up to be man's men and not sissies. As Zac goes through his mid-teens to early twenties, Zac isn't sure if he can live up to the ideals of either his mother or especially his father. A young man with stress-induced asthma, Zac just wants to be what he considers normal, which includes getting rid of his asthma. But more importantly, he wants to get rid of the underlying thoughts that he has and which most going through puberty have, but that for him are becoming more prevalent as he grows older.","languages":["French","English","German","Spanish","Polish"],"released":"2006-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","directors":["Jean-Marc Vall√®e"],"writers":["Fran√®ois Boulay","Jean-Marc Vall√®e"],"awards":{"wins":38,"nominations":7,"text":"38 wins & 7 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-08-26 00:39:47.493000000","year":2005,"imdb":{"rating":8,"votes":25594,"id":401085},"countries":["Canada"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":0,"numReviews":0},"website":"http://www.toskinacat.com","lastUpdated":"2015-06-23T19:53:16.000Z"},"num_mflix_comments":0},{"_id":"573a13bff29313caabd5fc7e","fullplot":"Denis revisits Africa, this time exploring a place rife with civil and racial conflict.

Driven by hidden needs, du Pont sees backing Schultz's bid for Gold and the chance to \"coach\" a world-class wrestling team as an opportunity to gain the elusive respect of his peers and, more importantly, his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave).

Though initially supportive, du Pont's mercurial personality turns and he begins to lure Mark into an unhealthy lifestyle that threatens to undermine his training. Soon du Pont's erratic behavior and cruel psychological game-play begin to erode the athlete's already shaky self-esteem. Meanwhile du Pont becomes fixated on Dave, who exudes the confidence both he and Mark lack, knowing that these are things even his money cannot buy.

He tries to speak to the key players in the case, most specifically Irene, who still works in the justice department and who he has always been attracted to but never pursued due to the differences in their ages and social classes.

Major media organisations like the BBC and The Guardian crumbled and apologised. But then they sued gardener Helen Steel and postman Dave Morris. In the longest trial in English legal history, the \"McLibel Two\" represented themselves against McDonald's √®10 million legal team. Every aspect of the corporation's business was cross-examined: from junk food and McJobs, to animal cruelty, environmental damage and advertising to children. Outside the courtroom, Dave brought up his young son alone and Helen supported herself working nights in a bar. McDonald's tried every trick in the book against them. Legal manoeuvres. A visit from Ronald McDonald. Top executives flying to London for secret settlement negotiations. Even spies. Seven years later, in February 2005, the marathon legal battle finally concluded at the European Court of Human Rights. And the result took everyone by surprise - especially the British Government. McLibel is not just about hamburgers. It is about the importance of freedom of speech now that multinational corporations are more powerful than countries. Filmed over ten years by no-budget Director Franny Armstrong, McLibel is the David and Goliath story of two people who refused to say sorry.

Regardless, they decide to join forces to embark on a life of crime, holding up whatever establishments, primarily banks, to make money and to have fun. They don't plan on hurting anyone physically or killing anyone despite wielding loaded guns. They amass a small gang of willing accomplices, including C.W. Moss, a mechanic to fix whatever cars they steal which is important especially for their getaways, and Buck Barrow, one of Clyde's older brothers. The only reluctant tag-along is Buck's nervous wife, Blanche Barrow, a preacher's daughter. The gang's life changes after the first fatal shot is fired. Following, their willingness to shoot to kill increases to protect themselves and their livelihood. Their notoriety precedes them, so much so that no matter what one's opinion is of them, most want to have some association to the Barrow gang, to help them, to be spoken in the same breath as them, or to capture and or kill them.

This sequence of family scenes in a Berlin flat complete with cat and dog creates a wondrous world of the everyday: Coming and going, all manner of doings, each movement leading to the next, one word following another. It is a carefully staged chain reaction of actions and sentences. And in between, silent gazes and anecdotes about experiences. The people act oddly even-temperedly; their dialogues are direct and unemotional. Even the pets and the material surroundings play a part. Some objects seem alive as if by magic. Commonplace actions and familiar items appear absurd and eerie in this narrative cosmos. Putting the absurdities of daily life on display and translating unspectacular events into an exciting choreography of everyday life, this film is no small feat.","languages":["German"],"released":"2014-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","directors":["Ramon Z√®rcher"],"writers":["Ramon Z√®rcher (screenplay)"],"awards":{"wins":5,"nominations":3,"text":"5 wins & 3 nominations."},"lastupdated":"2015-09-16 06:10:44.277000000","year":2013,"imdb":{"rating":6.6,"votes":572,"id":2586000},"countries":["Germany"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.kimstim.com/cat.html","viewer":{"rating":3.3,"numReviews":224,"meter":53},"critic":{"rating":7.1,"numReviews":15,"meter":73},"lastUpdated":"2015-08-03T19:58:15.000Z","rotten":4,"production":"Kimstim","fresh":11}},{"_id":"573a13c9f29313caabd7909f","plot":"In the summer of 2003, a group of shepherds took a herd of sheep one final time through the Beartooth Mountains of Montana, in the extreme northwest of the United States.

The production of food overall has more drastically changed since that time than the several thousand years prior. Controlled primarily by a handful of multinational corporations, the global food production business - with an emphasis on the business - has as its unwritten goals production of large quantities of food at low direct inputs (most often subsidized) resulting in enormous profits, which in turn results in greater control of the global supply of food sources within these few companies. Health and safety (of the food itself, of the animals produced themselves, of the workers on the assembly lines, and of the consumers actually eating the food) are often overlooked by the companies, and are often overlooked by government in an effort to provide cheap food regardless of these negative consequences. Many of the changes are based on advancements in science and technology, but often have negative side effects.The products made have been shown in several studies to enlarge male sexual organs and increase male breast size. The answer that the companies have come up with is to throw more science at the problems to bandage the issues but not the root causes. The global food supply may be in crisis with lack of biodiversity, but can be changed on the demand side of the equation.","imdb":{"rating":7.9,"votes":39062,"id":1286537},"year":2008,"plot":"An unflattering look inside America's corporate controlled food industry.","genres":["Documentary"],"rated":"PG","metacritic":80,"title":"Food, Inc.","lastupdated":"2015-08-24 00:10:14.307000000","languages":["English"],"writers":["Robert Kenner","Elise Pearlstein","Kim Roberts"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.foodincmovie.com/","viewer":{"rating":3.9,"numReviews":74146,"meter":86},"dvd":"2009-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","critic":{"rating":7.7,"numReviews":106,"meter":96},"boxOffice":"$4.2M","consensus":"An eye-opening expose of the modern food industry, Food, Inc. is both fascinating and terrifying, and essential viewing for any health-conscious citizen.","rotten":4,"production":"Magnolia Pictures","lastUpdated":"2015-09-16T18:25:51.000Z","fresh":102},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGNhYTA1ODMtY2M5Yy00MTYwLWFlZmEtNDM4M2I4ZTI2ZmVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTA4NzY1MzY@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":0,"released":"2009-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","awards":{"wins":8,"nominations":18,"text":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

In less than one month, Nietzsche would be diagnosed with a serious mental illness that would make him bed-ridden and speechless for the next eleven years until his death. But whatever did happen to the horse? This film, which is Tarr's last, follows up this question in a fictionalized story of what occurred. The man who whipped the horse is a rural farmer who makes his living taking on carting jobs into the city with his horse-drawn cart. The horse is old and in very poor health, but does its best to obey its master's commands. The farmer and his daughter must come to the understanding that it will be unable to go on sustaining their livelihoods.

The production of food overall has more drastically changed since that time than the several thousand years prior. Controlled primarily by a handful of multinational corporations, the global food production business - with an emphasis on the business - has as its unwritten goals production of large quantities of food at low direct inputs (most often subsidized) resulting in enormous profits, which in turn results in greater control of the global supply of food sources within these few companies. Health and safety (of the food itself, of the animals produced themselves, of the workers on the assembly lines, and of the consumers actually eating the food) are often overlooked by the companies, and are often overlooked by government in an effort to provide cheap food regardless of these negative consequences. Many of the changes are based on advancements in science and technology, but often have negative side effects.The products made have been shown in several studies to enlarge male sexual organs and increase male breast size. The answer that the companies have come up with is to throw more science at the problems to bandage the issues but not the root causes. The global food supply may be in crisis with lack of biodiversity, but can be changed on the demand side of the equation.","languages":["English"],"released":"2009-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","directors":["Robert Kenner"],"writers":["Robert Kenner","Elise Pearlstein","Kim Roberts"],"awards":{"wins":8,"nominations":18,"text":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

This passionate and fluid film is without question the first authentic history of surfing from its humble Hawaiian beginnings to the big business it became to the still-rebellious universe it inhabits today. Riding Giants is a study in individuality and freedom, the pursuit and techniques of pure kinetic pleasure, and the risk taking and attitudes that characterize its leading figures. For some viewers, this is perhaps more than they ever wanted to know. But Peralta's detailed knowledge of the surfing lifestyle, its icons and locations, its boom and exploitation by the media, and the fascination it has held for young men for more than five decades is unparalleled and fuels this expedition for the expert and initiate alike. Closely chronicling the sometimes-life-and-death drama that big-wave riding entails, Riding Giants is an often-mesmerizing visual thrill ride. But the most appealing aspect of this often revelatory documentary is the realization that the man versus nature dialectic never ends; the search for the ultimate wave and the spiritual pinnacle can only be pursued but never reached.","languages":["English"],"released":"2004-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","directors":["Stacy Peralta"],"writers":["Stacy Peralta","Sam George"],"awards":{"wins":1,"nominations":1,"text":"1 win & 1 nomination."},"lastupdated":"2015-08-19 00:40:16.063000000","year":2004,"imdb":{"rating":7.9,"votes":3676,"id":389326},"countries":["USA","France"],"type":"movie"},{"_id":"573a13a7f29313caabd1af22","plot":"Marianne, some thirty years after divorcing Johan, decides to visit her ex-husband at his summer home.

Emperor penguins in their thousands abandon the deep blue security of their ocean home and clamber onto the frozen ice to begin their long journey into a region so bleak, so extreme, it supports no other wildlife at this time of year. In single file, the penguins march blinded by blizzards, buffeted by gale force winds. Guided by instinct, by the otherworldly radiance of the Southern Cross, they head unerringly for their traditional breeding ground where--after a ritual courtship of intricate dances and delicate maneuvering, accompanied by a cacophony of ecstatic song--they will pair off into monogamous couples and mate. The females remain long enough only to lay a single egg. Once this is accomplished, exhausted by weeks without nourishment, they begin their return journey across the ice-field to the fish-filled seas. The male emperors are left behind to guard and hatch the precious eggs, which they cradle at all times on top of their feet. After two long months during which the males eat nothing, the eggs begin to hatch. Once they have emerged into their ghostly white new world, the chicks can not survive for long on their fathers' limited food reserves. If their mothers are late returning from the ocean with food, the newly-hatched young will die. Once the families are reunited, the roles reverse, the mothers remaining with their new young while their mates head, exhausted and starved, for the sea, and food. While the adults fish, the chicks face the ever-present threat of attack by prowling giant petrels. As the weather grows warmer and the ice floes finally begin to crack and melt, the adults will repeat their arduous journey countless times, marching many hundreds of miles over some of the most treacherous territory on Earth, until the chicks are ready to take their first faltering dive into the deep blue waters of the Antarctic.","imdb":{"rating":7.7,"votes":40076,"id":428803},"year":2005,"plot":"A look at the annual journey of Emperor penguins as they march -- single file -- to their traditional breeding ground.","genres":["Documentary"],"rated":"G","metacritic":79,"title":"March of the Penguins","lastupdated":"2015-09-02 10:41:01.727000000","languages":["French","English"],"writers":["Luc Jacquet (scenario)","Luc Jacquet (adaptation)","Michel Fessler (adaptation)","Jordan Roberts (narration: US edited version)"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://wip.warnerbros.com/marchofthepenguins/","viewer":{"rating":3.5,"numReviews":99388,"meter":81},"dvd":"2005-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","critic":{"rating":7.8,"numReviews":180,"meter":94},"boxOffice":"$77.4M","consensus":"Only the most hardened soul won't be moved by this heartwarming doc.","rotten":10,"production":"Warner Independent Pictures","lastUpdated":"2015-08-16T18:54:16.000Z","fresh":170},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NDc5MDYxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjMzNDAzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":1,"released":"2005-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","awards":{"wins":24,"nominations":12,"text":"Won 1 Oscar.

Charlie inherited Midway Plantation, the ancestral home of his and Cheshire's extended family, and has been its devoted caretaker. But now Charlie and his wife Dena have made a decision: They want to move Midway - the antebellum manor house and several outbuildings - to a new location to escape Raleigh's encroaching sprawl. Can you really transplant a plantation? Will the \"place\" be the same if it is uprooted from the soil in which it has stood since 1848? Charlie's plan provokes immediate controversy in Cheshire's tradition-minded family. For Cheshire, it brings back memories of the wild, strange and magical place Midway seemed when he was a child, and of the stories he heard there - stories of his mother's family, the Hintons, settling the area in the early 1700s, fighting in the Revolution, being invaded by Yankee troops in the Civil War, and surviving Reconstruction. Yet stories, Cheshire realizes, both convey and conceal. The reality of the Southern plantation was that it depended on the institution of slavery. In Cheshire's family, stories of slaves always depicted them as happy and devoted, which surely disguised a more painful, complex reality. In fact, Midway bred two sets of Hintons, one white, one black. For years, they have rarely encountered each other. But that begins to change as Cheshire sets out to chronicle Charlie's attempt to move Midway.","languages":["English"],"released":"2007-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","directors":["Godfrey Cheshire"],"awards":{"wins":0,"nominations":1,"text":"1 nomination."},"lastupdated":"2015-07-11 00:40:36.603000000","year":2007,"imdb":{"rating":7.1,"votes":137,"id":1051245},"countries":["USA"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://www.movingmidway.com/","viewer":{"rating":3.7,"numReviews":145,"meter":64},"dvd":"2009-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","critic":{"rating":7.8,"numReviews":25,"meter":100},"lastUpdated":"2015-09-13T17:40:29.000Z","consensus":"This strange, heartfelt documentary from film critic Godfrey Cheshire is a fascinating examination of his family roots, as well as an evocative meditation on the complexities of the South.","rotten":0,"production":"First Run Features","fresh":25}},{"_id":"573a13a0f29313caabd04465","fullplot":"Gal, Deedee, Aitch and Jackie, having left behind respective lives of ill-repute, bask in the sun of Spain and in the most essential brand of leisure.

Emperor penguins in their thousands abandon the deep blue security of their ocean home and clamber onto the frozen ice to begin their long journey into a region so bleak, so extreme, it supports no other wildlife at this time of year. In single file, the penguins march blinded by blizzards, buffeted by gale force winds. Guided by instinct, by the otherworldly radiance of the Southern Cross, they head unerringly for their traditional breeding ground where--after a ritual courtship of intricate dances and delicate maneuvering, accompanied by a cacophony of ecstatic song--they will pair off into monogamous couples and mate. The females remain long enough only to lay a single egg. Once this is accomplished, exhausted by weeks without nourishment, they begin their return journey across the ice-field to the fish-filled seas. The male emperors are left behind to guard and hatch the precious eggs, which they cradle at all times on top of their feet. After two long months during which the males eat nothing, the eggs begin to hatch. Once they have emerged into their ghostly white new world, the chicks can not survive for long on their fathers' limited food reserves. If their mothers are late returning from the ocean with food, the newly-hatched young will die. Once the families are reunited, the roles reverse, the mothers remaining with their new young while their mates head, exhausted and starved, for the sea, and food. While the adults fish, the chicks face the ever-present threat of attack by prowling giant petrels. As the weather grows warmer and the ice floes finally begin to crack and melt, the adults will repeat their arduous journey countless times, marching many hundreds of miles over some of the most treacherous territory on Earth, until the chicks are ready to take their first faltering dive into the deep blue waters of the Antarctic.","imdb":{"rating":7.7,"votes":40078,"id":428803},"year":2005,"plot":"A look at the annual journey of Emperor penguins as they march -- single file -- to their traditional breeding ground.","genres":["Documentary"],"rated":"G","metacritic":79,"title":"March of the Penguins","lastupdated":"2015-09-02 13:46:58.490000000","languages":["French","English"],"writers":["Luc Jacquet (scenario)","Luc Jacquet (adaptation)","Michel Fessler (adaptation)","Jordan Roberts (narration: US edited version)"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://wip.warnerbros.com/marchofthepenguins/","viewer":{"rating":3.5,"numReviews":99388,"meter":81},"dvd":"2005-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","critic":{"rating":7.8,"numReviews":180,"meter":94},"boxOffice":"$77.4M","consensus":"Only the most hardened soul won't be moved by this heartwarming doc.","rotten":10,"production":"Warner Independent Pictures","lastUpdated":"2015-08-16T18:54:16.000Z","fresh":170},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NDc5MDYxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjMzNDAzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":1,"released":"2005-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","awards":{"wins":24,"nominations":12,"text":"Won 1 Oscar.

Now at age 75, Rivers has faced her ups and downs in her forty plus year career, the year leading up to filming being a down compared to what she would have wanted, which is a calendar full of engagements with several engagements each day. That want is in part to support her opulent personal lifestyle, but is more a need to bolster her own sense of self-worth as a basically insecure person who is probably best known now for her overuse of cosmetic surgery rather than her professional work. She feels that Kathy Griffin, who she admires, is now getting all the engagements she would have gotten in her prime. During this year, Rivers is seen going from engagement to engagement, some big - such as a Kennedy Center Honors for George Carlin, a double bill with Don Rickles in New York, and her own celebrity roast on Comedy Central (which she really isn't looking forward to) - and some not so big. But perhaps the most important of these to her is the opening of her new play, which she is testing in Edinburgh, important in that she wants to be seen as an actress; and an appearance on a celebrity version of The Apprentice (2004), important in that it will mark her first appearance on NBC since being blacklisted by them for her disagreement with Johnny Carson over the start of her own talk show on rival Fox back in 1989.

Winner of the Grammy for Lifetime Achievement and member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, Glen was the first country music star to cross over to the pop charts, opening a new realm of opportunity for generations of country musicians. In 2011, when Campbell was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, he joined forces with his family to fight the biggest battle of his life. Glen and his wife, Kim, made history by going public with the diagnosis - the first time a major American celebrity would share this experience with the world. The Campbell family then embarked on a short \"Goodbye Tour,\" but the three-week engagement turned into an emotional and triumphant 151-show nationwide tour de force. This epic human drama about the undying bond between Glen and Kim, and their unwavering caring for each other, chronicles a story of love, resilience and the power of song. GLEN CAMPBELL...I'LL BE ME is the true tale of how America's greatest country star would not give up his music or his family, against all odds. The film features those who know and love Glen, including Bruce Springsteen, Bill Clinton, The Edge, Paul McCartney, Jay Leno, Vince Gill, Jimmy Webb, Blake Shelton, Sheryl Crow, Keith Urban, Brad Paisley, Steve Martin, Chad Smith and Taylor Swift among many others. Rare vintage footage and extraordinary new performances of Glen's most beloved hits immerse this moving cinematic account in the overwhelming talent of this humble family man. With joy and a tireless sense of humor, Glen and his family live each moment in the present while preparing for the future, all while playing their music to sold out venues on a star spangled voyage spanning the country from Carnegie Hall to the Hollywood Bowl.","languages":["English"],"released":"2014-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","directors":["James Keach"],"rated":"PG","awards":{"wins":4,"nominations":11,"text":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

Briefly, a drifter (Randall Adams) ran out of gas and was picked up by a 16-year-old runaway (David Harris). Later that night, they drank some beer, smoked some marijuana, and went to the movies. Then, their stories diverged. Adams claimed that he left for his motel, where he was staying with his brother, and went to sleep. Harris, however, said that they were stopped by police late that night, and Adams suddenly shot the officer approaching their car. The film shows the audience the evidence gathered by the police, who were under extreme pressure to clear the case. It strongly makes a point that the circumstantial evidence was very flimsy. In fact, it becomes apparent that Harris was a much more likely suspect and was in the middle of a crime spree, eventually ending up on Death Row himself for the later commission of other crimes. Morris implies that the DA's and the judge's desire for the death penalty in this case (for which Harris would have been ineligible because of his youth) made Adams a scapegoat on whom to pin this heinous crime.","imdb":{"rating":8.1,"votes":13118,"id":96257},"year":1988,"plot":"A film that successfully argued that a man was wrongly convicted for murder by a corrupt justice system in Dallas County, Texas.","genres":["Documentary","Crime","Mystery"],"rated":"NOT RATED","metacritic":79,"title":"The Thin Blue Line","lastupdated":"2015-08-21 00:07:03.313000000","languages":["English"],"writers":["Errol Morris"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"viewer":{"rating":4.1,"numReviews":8108,"meter":90},"dvd":"2005-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","critic":{"rating":9,"numReviews":14,"meter":100},"lastUpdated":"2015-08-20T18:09:27.000Z","rotten":0,"production":"HBO Video","fresh":14},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE3MTViMDUtNjkxYy00NWY2LTg5MzEtYjFiNzRkMTgwYTJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":0,"released":"1988-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","awards":{"wins":11,"nominations":4,"text":"11 wins & 4 nominations."},"countries":["USA"],"cast":["Randall Adams","David Harris","Gus Rose","Jackie Johnson"],"directors":["Errol Morris"],"runtime":103},{"_id":"573a13b1f29313caabd36b9a","fullplot":"In 1945, the Marines attack twelve thousand Japaneses protecting the twenty square kilometers of the sacred Iwo Jima island in a very violent battle.

With lawyers' bills mounting for his divorce, Arthur's criminal court appearances and a land feud with a neighbour Larry is tempted to take the bribe offered by a student to give him an illegal exam pass mark. And the rabbis he visits for advice only dole out platitudes. Still God moves in mysterious - and not always pleasant - ways, as Larry and his family will find out.","imdb":{"rating":7,"votes":93495,"id":1019452},"year":2009,"plot":"Larry Gopnik, a Midwestern physics teacher, watches his life unravel over multiple sudden incidents.

Prok goes on to become a biology professor at Indiana University, initially focusing on the study of gall wasps. But those studies in combination with questions from his students, coming to terms with the needs of sex with his own wife, a former student of his named Clara McMillen (who he calls Mac), and what he sees as the gross misinformation on the subject currently within popular belief makes him change his focus to human sexuality. Many of those gross untruths - as he sees them - are that oral sex and masturbation cause a slew of maladies, which are perpetuated by what is presented in the university's hygiene class taught by Professor Thurman Rice. With the approval of faculty head Herman Wells, Prok starts teaching his own wildly popular marriage course, talking about sex in a straightforwardly academic fashion. When he sees that morals don't necessarily mirror sexual behavior, he decides to conduct a massive sex survey with the assistance of students Wardell Pomeroy, Clyde Martin and Paul Gebhard. He faces the issue of the funding required for the survey and public and political response to this controversial and oft seen as taboo subject. But in conducting the survey, he and Mac also face the issue of their own sexuality in relationship to their marriage and the emotional and cultural aspects behind it, such as the notion of love.","languages":["English"],"released":"2005-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","directors":["Bill Condon"],"writers":["Bill Condon"],"awards":{"wins":20,"nominations":40,"text":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.

Emperor penguins in their thousands abandon the deep blue security of their ocean home and clamber onto the frozen ice to begin their long journey into a region so bleak, so extreme, it supports no other wildlife at this time of year. In single file, the penguins march blinded by blizzards, buffeted by gale force winds. Guided by instinct, by the otherworldly radiance of the Southern Cross, they head unerringly for their traditional breeding ground where--after a ritual courtship of intricate dances and delicate maneuvering, accompanied by a cacophony of ecstatic song--they will pair off into monogamous couples and mate. The females remain long enough only to lay a single egg. Once this is accomplished, exhausted by weeks without nourishment, they begin their return journey across the ice-field to the fish-filled seas. The male emperors are left behind to guard and hatch the precious eggs, which they cradle at all times on top of their feet. After two long months during which the males eat nothing, the eggs begin to hatch. Once they have emerged into their ghostly white new world, the chicks can not survive for long on their fathers' limited food reserves. If their mothers are late returning from the ocean with food, the newly-hatched young will die. Once the families are reunited, the roles reverse, the mothers remaining with their new young while their mates head, exhausted and starved, for the sea, and food. While the adults fish, the chicks face the ever-present threat of attack by prowling giant petrels. As the weather grows warmer and the ice floes finally begin to crack and melt, the adults will repeat their arduous journey countless times, marching many hundreds of miles over some of the most treacherous territory on Earth, until the chicks are ready to take their first faltering dive into the deep blue waters of the Antarctic.","imdb":{"rating":7.7,"votes":40127,"id":428803},"year":2005,"plot":"A look at the annual journey of Emperor penguins as they march -- single file -- to their traditional breeding ground.","genres":["Documentary"],"rated":"G","metacritic":79,"title":"March of the Penguins","lastupdated":"2015-09-06 00:04:58.977000000","languages":["French","English"],"writers":["Luc Jacquet (scenario)","Luc Jacquet (adaptation)","Michel Fessler (adaptation)","Jordan Roberts (narration: US edited version)"],"type":"movie","tomatoes":{"website":"http://wip.warnerbros.com/marchofthepenguins/","viewer":{"rating":3.5,"numReviews":99388,"meter":81},"dvd":"2005-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","critic":{"rating":7.8,"numReviews":180,"meter":94},"boxOffice":"$77.4M","consensus":"Only the most hardened soul won't be moved by this heartwarming doc.","rotten":10,"production":"Warner Independent Pictures","lastUpdated":"2015-08-16T18:54:16.000Z","fresh":170},"poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NDc5MDYxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjMzNDAzMQ@@._V1_SY1000_SX677_AL_.jpg","num_mflix_comments":1,"released":"2005-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","awards":{"wins":24,"nominations":12,"text":"Won 1 Oscar.
